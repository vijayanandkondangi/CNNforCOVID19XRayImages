# CNN for COVID 19 X Ray Images

This notebook illustrates a very simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework for classifying X rays (as COVID 19, Normal or Pneumonia).

The trained CNN model is also available in the repository as a h5 file.

This is based on the dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia

Such models can free up a doctor's time by providing a preliminary diagnosis.
